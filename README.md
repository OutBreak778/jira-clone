Jira Clone Project
This project is a clone of the popular project management tool, Jira, built to facilitate task tracking and collaboration within teams. Developed using Next.js, Appwrite, and Tailwind CSS, this application replicates core Jira functionalities, such as project and task management, user authentication, and workspace organization.

Key Features
1. User Authentication
User login, registration, and session management are powered by Appwrite.
Authentication ensures secure data access, allowing only authorized users to view and interact with project tasks and information.
Cookies are used to store user sessions, ensuring data privacy and a seamless login experience.
2. Project and Workspace Management
Users can create and manage multiple workspaces, helping teams organize different projects.
Each workspace contains projects that can hold a variety of tasks, statuses, and assignees.
3. Task Management
Tasks can be created, updated, and deleted within projects.
Each task supports the following attributes:
Name
Description
Status (such as "To Do," "In Progress," "Done")
Assignee (assigned to a team member)
Due Date
Tasks are listed based on their priority and status, helping users focus on important items.
4. Role-Based Access Control
Role-based access ensures that users can only perform actions within their authorized workspace.
Members with different roles have varied permissions within projects, ensuring that task visibility and modification are controlled effectively.
5. Workspace-Based Routing
Workspace-specific routing makes it possible for each workspace to have a unique identifier.
Pages within each workspace are loaded based on this identifier, enabling seamless navigation between multiple workspaces.
6. Real-Time Updates
Appwrite is utilized for real-time data updates, ensuring changes in tasks or projects are immediately visible to all team members within a workspace.
7. Responsive Design
The project is built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring responsiveness and a clean UI that works well across devices, including mobile and desktop.
